Copy line 3 in its entirety, go to your library, right-click on CS:GO, click "Set launch options" and paste what you just copied.

Notes:
"-high" might be a bad idea if your computer's specification is not up to par with today's standards. 
"+mat_queue_mode 2" may increase your fps, but can also make it fluctuate. Use with caution.
"-d3d9ex" is now on by default in CS:GO and is therefore superfluous. I have kept it only as a reminder of the good ol' days.
